# Notepad-Clone
 My project is made in Abstract Window Tooklkit which is part of the java foundational classes. 
 AWT is a standard API providing a graphical user interface for any java program. With the help 
 of AWT it helped me to build the GUI of the application which gives very good experience to the users of the application. 
 A good experience to the user using this interface as it will open in a separate windows. This application written in 
 core java, there are no complex languages and libaries involved. I also used Classes, Objects and various JAVA Swing Components 
 like Jframe, Jtext and JButton etc.
